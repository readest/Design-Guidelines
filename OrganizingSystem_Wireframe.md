# Overview
This document tackle:
- Which information goes where on the Library view.
- Which button should be available.

This document does not tackle:
- The specific look of the UI or anything regarding aesthetic.
- Anything outside of the Library View.

A quick sketch for the Organizing System. UX design always needs to be iterated quite a few times before it's ready to be shipped so please feedback away.

# Things to look at when giving feedback
   - Has every button/information necessary for Organizing Library behavior been added?
   - Is all information in its correct place? Is the important information visible enough?
   - Very important: what do you think about the Group and Collection system? Does it work as what you intended in this document?
