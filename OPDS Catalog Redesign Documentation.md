# The Problem

# Solutions

I created this branch to suggest a different user flow than what we currently have. Here's the suggested user flow. A few takeaways: (1) User should be able to navigate through everything in Online Library with just < and > buttons alone (2) The interface should be closable at anytime --> which is why I suggest going with Pop-up window.
